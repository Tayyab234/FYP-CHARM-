# FYP-CHARM-
 CHARM – Chicken Health Assessment through Real-time Monitoring
🔍 Project Overview
The CHARM project is a deep learning-based poultry health monitoring system designed to detect, track, and classify diseases in chickens using computer vision. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the core functionality of the CHARM pipeline, which integrates object detection, tracking, and multithreaded disease classification using multiple neural network models.

The system uses:

YOLOv11 Models for full-body and neck-region detection.

BoT-SORT Algorithm for multi-object tracking to maintain chicken identities across frames.

ResNet50 Classifiers for both general and specific disease categorization.

Multithreading to process detections and classifications concurrently, enabling real-time performance.

The notebook processes videos/images to detect chickens, track their movement, classify health status, and output annotated media with color-coded bounding boxes (green for healthy, orange for Marek’s, red for other diseases). The system is optimized for real poultry farm conditions, handling clutter, variable lighting, and occlusions.
